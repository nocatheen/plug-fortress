# Plug Fortress

Disclamer - this is VERY alpha, only basic functions are working (and still not always as intended).

## Instructions

1. Download and install Intiface Central and Plug Fortress;
2. Start Intiface server;
3. Launch Plug Fortress, use "Toy" tab to scan for and enable your device; don't forget to adjust max power settings here;
4. Enable what events to listen for in "Features" tab;
5. Switch the giant "ENABLE SERVICE" switch to enable the service;
6. have fun i guess.

## TODO

- Complete README.md lol
- Rewrite everything from scratch because it this thing sucks rn
